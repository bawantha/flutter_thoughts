# Using Isolates in Flutter

Isolates are lightweight threads that run code concurrently with other isolates and the main thread. They are useful in situations where you want to perform a computationally expensive task without blocking the user interface or while keeping the user interface responsive. This tutorial will demonstrate how to use isolates in Flutter.

## Starting an Isolate 

```dart
import 'dart:isolate';

main() async {
  Isolate newIsolate = await Isolate.spawn(myIsolate, 'Hello!');
}

void myIsolate(String message) async {
  print(message);
}
```

In the `main()` function, we use the `Isolate.spawn()` method to start a new isolate. We pass in our `myIsolate` function as the first argument, and a string `'Hello!'` as the second argument. The `myIsolate` function will receive this message when it is invoked. 

## Communicating with an Isolate

```dart
import 'dart:isolate';

main() async {
  ReceivePort receivePort = ReceivePort();
  Isolate newIsolate = await Isolate.spawn(myIsolate, receivePort.sendPort);

  receivePort.listen((message) {
    print('Received message from isolate: $message');
  });
}

void myIsolate(SendPort callerPort) async {
  String message = 'Hello from isolate!';
  callerPort.send(message);
}
```

In the `main()` function, we create a `ReceivePort` which is used to listen for messages that are sent from the isolate. We then pass the `sendPort` of the `ReceivePort` to the isolate through `Isolate.spawn()`. 

In the `myIsolate` function, we receive the `SendPort` and use it to send a message `'Hello from isolate!'` back to the main thread.

## Conclusion

Isolates are a powerful tool for handling long-running or computationally expensive tasks in Flutter. They allow us to perform work that might otherwise block the main thread, keeping our app responsive and smooth.
